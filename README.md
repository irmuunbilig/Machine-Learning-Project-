# Machine Learning Project 
 
This project addresses the critical challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue a company's services, resulting in lost revenue and potential business instability. Effectively predicting churn is essential for businesses, enabling them to implement proactive retention strategies, reduce losses, and preserve a loyal customer base.
In this project, we analyse a telecommunications company dataset comprising demographic information, service usage patterns, account details, and payment methods for 3,749 customers. The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting which customers are at risk of churning, allowing the company to take preemptive actions to retain these customers.
